# JLearn
A website that lets you learn Hiragana and Katakana, the two necessary alphabets in Japanese.
The applications works by using flashcards, while the answers get handled client-sided,
the server will create sessions and handle the taken time & result calculation.
If possible, i will also add basic Kanji in the future.

If used locally you will have to start Chrome, or whatever browser you're using with CORS
being disabled since it blocks the API requests.
