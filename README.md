# JLearn
A website that lets you learn Hiragana And Katakana, the two necessary alphabets in Japanese.
The applications works by using flashcards, while the answers get handled client-sided,
the server will create sessions and handle the taken time & result calculation.
If possible, i will also add basic Kanji in the future.
